# World Weather Analysis


## Project Overview
A travel planning company, PlanMyTrip, has tasked me with an exploratory analysis to collect weather data for cities around the world, visualize the relationships between location and weather variables, and use user inputs to produce heatmaps.


### Purpose
1. Generate a list of random locations
2. Identify the closest cities to those locations
3. Collect the weather data for each of those cities
4. Create scatter plots to illustrate the relationships between latitude and the following variables:
  - temperature
  - humidity
  - cloudiness
  - wind speed
5. Perform linear regression for the above relationships
6. Create heatmaps for the above relationships
7. Create a heatmap to visualize potential vacation choices based on user temperature preferences

### Resources
  - Data Sources: Weather_data/cities.csv
                  Weather_database/WeatherPy_Database.csv
              
  - Software: Python 3.6.1, Jupyter Notebook, Google Maps API

### Results

## Challenge Overview
PlanMyTrip tasked me with collection additional weather data and using user choices to create vacattio itineraries.

### Challenge Purpose
1. Collec the general description of weather for each city
2. Display potential hotel choices for user vacations based on user preferences
3. Produce travel itinerary and directions based on users' choice of 4 destinations
